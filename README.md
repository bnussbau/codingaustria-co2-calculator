## Challenge: Sustainable Living

### What problem we are solving

For eg: in Austria, 400,000,000 packages get delivered per year and it grows by 15% every year. It means approximately 600g CO2 per package: 400M \* 600

Interestingly, only 50% of packages delivers successfully on the first try.

With our solution of BUNDLING packages. delivery succesfull rate will raise from 50% to 80%.
